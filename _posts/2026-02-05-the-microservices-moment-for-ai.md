Something familiar is happening in AI right now.

<!-- INTRO: Set up the parallel - readers who lived through the monolith-to-microservices transition will recognize the pattern -->

## The Monolith Phase

<!-- Talk about 2024-2025: single-purpose agents, the "one model to rule them all" mentality, the appeal of the all-knowing assistant -->

## Why Monoliths Break Down

<!-- Where single agents hit walls: context limits, reliability at scale, the "jack of all trades" problem -->

## The Orchestration Shift

<!-- Multi-agent systems, specialized agents with clear boundaries, the emergence of agent-to-agent protocols -->

## What We Learned From Software

<!-- Draw on microservices lessons: service boundaries, failure isolation, independent deployment, the coordination tax -->

## What's Different This Time

<!-- Where the analogy breaks down - agents have judgment, context matters differently, the "conversation" problem -->

## What I'm Watching

<!-- Concrete things to pay attention to: MCP adoption, orchestration frameworks, how enterprises are actually deploying this -->
