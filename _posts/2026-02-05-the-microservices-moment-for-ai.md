Something familiar is happening in AI right now.

{% comment %} INTRO: Set up the parallel - readers who lived through the monolith-to-microservices transition will recognize the pattern {% endcomment %}

## The Monolith Phase

{% comment %} Talk about 2024-2025: single-purpose agents, the "one model to rule them all" mentality, the appeal of the all-knowing assistant {% endcomment %}

## Why Monoliths Break Down

{% comment %} Where single agents hit walls: context limits, reliability at scale, the "jack of all trades" problem {% endcomment %}

## The Orchestration Shift

{% comment %} Multi-agent systems, specialized agents with clear boundaries, the emergence of agent-to-agent protocols {% endcomment %}

## What We Learned From Software

{% comment %} Draw on microservices lessons: service boundaries, failure isolation, independent deployment, the coordination tax {% endcomment %}

## What's Different This Time

{% comment %} Where the analogy breaks down - agents have judgment, context matters differently, the "conversation" problem {% endcomment %}

## What I'm Watching

{% comment %} Concrete things to pay attention to: MCP adoption, orchestration frameworks, how enterprises are actually deploying this {% endcomment %}
